# p5play Personal License

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the p5play software library ("Content"), you ("Licensee") agree to the following terms, as set by Quinton Ashley ("Licensor"), the sole copyright owner.

This license is intended to enable free, personal use of the Content.

**_For commercial use, see the [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/pro)._**

**_For educational use, see the [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach)._**

## 1. License Grant

The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Content in accordance with these terms.

If you have entered into a separate written agreement with the Licensor regarding your use of the Content, the terms of that agreement shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with this License.

### 1a. Shared Work

Users can share work that uses the Content only if the work is open source. The entire codebase of the work must be:

- freely and publicly accessible on the internet, without restrictions
- in human readable form, not minified or obfuscated, but in the preferred form for making modifications
- licensed as AGPL, GPL, CC BY-SA, CC BY, ISC, MIT, or CC0 (public domain)

The Licensee is permitted to distribute their programs in a compiled or minified form only if the source code is made available alongside it.

If a web server/client-side web app ("Website") uses the Content as part of the Website's code or in a work generated by the Website's code, the entire codebase for the Website must be open source. Yet, if the Website merely hosts user generated content that uses p5play, only the user is required to make their own content open source.

### 1b. Limited Redistribution

The Licensee may host verbatim, unmodified copies of the Content with a copy of this license alongside it. The Licensee may not sell or sublicense the Content.

### 1c. Derivative Works

Publishing modified versions of the Content ("Derivative Work") is permitted only for the purpose of contributing directly to the original p5play project (for example, by creating a temporary fork to submit a pull request or patch to the official repository).

The Licensee may not use the Content to create a competing product or service.

### 1d. No Commercial Use

The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content for commercial purposes, which includes any activity that involves monetary exchange, promotes a business entity (including non-profits), or results in direct or indirect financial gain.

To use the Content commercially, create an account on p5play.org and agree to the [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/pro).

### 1e. Educational Use Limitation

Under fair use, the Licensee may produce educational content, such as YouTube tutorials, that explains and showcases use of the Content in a fixed media format, which does not enable direct interaction with the Content.

The Content can also be used in interactive art that is educational in nature, but the topics covered must not be related to computer programming or game development. For example, a game that teaches players how to cook is permitted.

Typical academic use of the Content, such as in class instruction or coursework, is prohibited under this License.

To use the Content for academic purposes, create an account on p5play.org, pay license fees as determined by the Licensor, and agree to the [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach). This is required even if the Content is used indirectly through a third-party provider.

### 1f. No Military Use

The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content in projects that are directly endorsed by military organizations or military contractors.

### 1g. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Use of the "made with p5play" Loading Screen is required for all published work that uses p5play, unless the work is published on an online code editing platform or other web app that was approved by the Licensor to be exempt from this requirement, in which case the loading screen will not appear. Attribution can then be made at the top of the primary script file or in a README file. The following is an example of acceptable attribution:

```js
/**
 * Made with p5play!
 * https://p5play.org
 */
```

## 2. Licensee Eligibility Requirements

Anyone can use the Content for free under this License, provided they comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

## 3. Privacy

Licensees optionally consent to p5play using Google Analytics to track how they use p5play. To revoke this consent, you can use a browser extension to block Google Analytics or set `window._p5play_gtagged = false;` before loading p5play.

## 4. No Warranty

The Content is provided "as is." The Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, concerning the Content.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

Licensees must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using p5play. It is illegal to create content that infringes on the rights of others. Licensees are fully liable for any content they create with p5play.

## 6. Amendments

This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

## 7. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all use and distribution of the Content.

## 8. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
