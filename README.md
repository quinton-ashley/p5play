p5.play is a p5.js library for the creation of games and playthings.

p5.play provides a Sprite class to manage visual objects in 2D space and features such as animation support, basic collision detection and resolution, sprite grouping, helpers for mouse and keyboard interactions, and a virtual camera.

p5.play was created by Paolo Pedercini [@molleindustria][] and is currently maintained by Quinton Ashley [@quinton-ashley][]. If you have any questions or problems make an [issue report][] on this GitHub repository or email <qashto@gmail.com>

## Using p5.play

You can find interactive examples and documentation at [p5play.molleindustria.org][].

p5.play extends [p5.js][], a JavaScript library (and community) that aims to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. If you are not familiar with p5.js, you should start by looking at [p5js.org/learn][].

Here is a direct link to the [p5.play library][]. You can easily use this JavaScript file by adding the following script tag to your html within the head or body tag.

```html
<script src="https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/lib/p5.play.js"></script>
```

You can also install the [p5.play npm package][].

```
npm install p5.play
```
